# Enroll client on SMS Appointment Remainder Program

Appointment remainders ensure we can send a notification to client reminding them of their upcoming appointment at the facility.

This appointment remainder depends on the return date assigned to a client on his/her past visit 

The SMS remainder is set to be sent a week before the expected appointment week.

It is also advised that we first educate and get consent of a client to enroll them on the SMS Program

The steps below guide on how to register a client to the SMS program after they have consented.
