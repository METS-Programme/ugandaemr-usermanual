# Reporting

The reporting functionality helps users to extract information in pre-built and custom reports to meet reporting needs for managing facility operations, meeting MoH and support other programatic work.

The reports are generated in the following ways:

1. [BIRT Reports](https://github.com/METS-Programme/ugandaemr-usermanual/tree/1fbbe0b2801ddccebeb5041ed0f406697a3b1f0a/reporting_birt.md) for facility level and some MoH HMIS reports 
2. [Cohort Builder](reporting_cohort_builder.md) for custom data extraction in Excel for more detailed analysis
