# Reporting

The reporting functionality helps users to extract information in pre-built and custom reports to meet reporting needs for managing facility operations, meeting MoH and support other programatic work.

The reports are generated in the following ways:

1. [Inbuilt reports](ugandaemr_reports.md) for facility level, MoH HMIS and PEPFAR MER Indicator reports 
2. [Cohort Builder](reporting_cohort_builder.md) for custom data extraction in Excel for more detailed analysis
