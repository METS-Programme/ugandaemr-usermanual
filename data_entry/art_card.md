### Transfer In

A transfer occurs when a patient who is currently in care in one facility, moves to start receiving care from your facility.

1. The `HIV Enrolled Date` for the client is the date when they first come to your facility to receive care and is the date they are entered in the Pre-ART Register and assigned a number.
2. In this case the `ART Start Date` can be earlier than the `HIV Enrolled` date 
3. Set the `Eligible for ART` and the `Eligible and Ready` dates to be the same date as the `HIV Enrolled Date` to overcome a validation check in UgandaEMR 2.0.0 

For a patient enrolled into care on April 7, 2018, started ART on September 12, 2018, then transferred into a facility on July 1, 2019. The dates are as follows:

* HIV Enrolled Date - `July 1, 2019`
* Eligible for ART - `July 1, 2019`
* Eligible and Ready - `July 1, 2019`
* ART Start Date - `September 12, 2018`

### Viral Load Data

The recommendation for entering viral loads is as follows:  
1. Enter the viral load in the first encounter after the results have been received at the facility  
2. The viral load information is entered on the ART Encounter page from the results slip in the bottom left hand corner as follows:

* Date Viral Load Taken - the date when the patient was bled for viral load 
* Viral Load Results:
  * Detected - a viral load result was detected which enables the Viral Load field to enter the copies found 
  * Not Detected - no viral load detected 
  * Sample Rejected - there are issues with the sample so the patient has to be bled again 
* Viral Load - the copies per ml
