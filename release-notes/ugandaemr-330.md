# 3.3.0 - December 2021 

## New Features

1. Community Pharmacy Dispensing 
   * Enable and Disable CRPDDP Feature
   * Ability to add Pharmacies as cohorts to which patients are added 
   * Add a CRPDDP Pharmacy to a client on the ART Summary page

2. ART Regimen Lines 
   * Add a Regimen Change List Report to show the list of regimen change encounters in a period

This allows a regimen change to be recorded for a patient who has transferred in but has had an ART Clinical encounter recorded with a different regimen from the transfer-in regimen 
   * The Regimen Change form can be completed when a client only has the ART Summary page completed 
3. Reports

4. HTS Client Card 
   * Added Social Network Strategy (SNS) as a reason for testing 
   * Added the ability to capture the ANC visit number when the ANC entry point is selected to enable accurate computation of the ANC1 and Post ANC1 segregations in the HTS_TST_Facility MER Indicator report 
5. Reports 
   * Active in Care report now exlcudes clients who transferred out, returned as transfer-ins and are active in care 
   * HTS_TST_Facility - added logic for computing the data across ANC1, ANC1+, Social Network Strategy and APN + Index Testing other than APN  
   * Appointment List, Lost and Lost to Followup Facility Reports now include client ART Clinic numbers 
   * TX_RTT report does not include the patients who had a clinical visit in the previous month
