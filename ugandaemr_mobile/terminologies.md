| Term | Definition |

| Concept | The concept is the basic element of flexibility in OpenMRS. Concepts are the individual data points collected from a population of patients. Concepts include both questions and answers.   For example, blood type data is collected for a patient.  The question is "What is the blood type for the patient?", with a set of discrete answers of "A, B, AB or O".  To implement this in OpenMRS with concepts, the question is a concept \("**blood type**"\) and each response \("A", "B", "AB" and "O"\) is also a concept.  For this one question, a total of 5 concepts are required. |
| Encounter | A single, specific interaction between the patient and a provider. An encounter can be any interaction and includes doctor visits, laboratory tests, food distribution, home visits, counselor appointments, etc. Each encounter must an encounter type, date/time, location and provider. |
